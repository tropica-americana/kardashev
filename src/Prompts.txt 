make me a python code using matplot lib that does that following 
1. that asks me the nameOfTheBa and the happinessIndex in the job  which it is going to draw , its cappedSalary which is basically the minimum amount of money i am going to make 
2. it also asks me uncappedSalary which is the maximum amount of money i am going to make
3.it shades the region below capped in light blue 
4. it shades the region below the unCapped in light red therefore giving a lightRed region of uncappedSalary - cappedSalary
5. on the top it displays " happinessIndex  {userEnteredNumber}" 
6.it keeps asking about these bars 
and at the end of each bar asks end [y/n] if the user enters n 
then it termiantes and displays the graph 

now gpt i want you to do a coupe of things for me 
you see i want o create a 3d model designing system in c++ and using SDL 
what i want you to do is 
1. tell me which is the best method and database structure for me to save my models considerng my 
my model has the following structure a. it can hold any amount of vertices 
b. each verticee has a x y and z positon 
c. the x y and z are always less than one 
d. each model is saved with the name as string for example "pyramid" , "square"
e.there can only be one model with the same name of the string 





write me a pytho code that draws a bell curve using matplotlib 
and asks the user the the standard deviation range 
for example input 1 = 2  ,input 2 =  3 
and then plots the bell curve and the curve is shaded in light blue curve 
and shades the region between input1 and input2 in light red 


make a python that does the following 
it draws the bar graph that plots the efficiecy on the y axis and the number of cosecutive on the x-axis 
and also label the x and y axis with their respective names 
name of the graph should be efficiency against number of cosecutive days task is performed 
and the there is 30 percent drop in efficiency with each cosecutive increase in the consecutive days number 


also add this property that if in between there is a break in the y axis that is if the y axis goes to zero 
there is 50 percent regeneration in the efficiency 
and the efficiency goes to 100 percent after 2 day break
