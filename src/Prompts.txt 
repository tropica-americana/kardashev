make me a python code using matplot lib that does that following 
1. that asks me the nameOfTheBa and the happinessIndex in the job  which it is going to draw , its cappedSalary which is basically the minimum amount of money i am going to make 
2. it also asks me uncappedSalary which is the maximum amount of money i am going to make
3.it shades the region below capped in light blue 
4. it shaes the region below the unCapped in light red therefore giving a lightRed region of uncappedSalary - cappedSalary
5. on the top it displays " happinessIndex  {userEnteredNumber}" 
6.it keeps asking about these bars 
and at the end of each bar asks end [y/n] if the user enters n 
then it termiantes and displays the graph 

now gpt i want you to do a coupe of things for me 
you see i want o create a 3d model designing system in c++ and using SDL 
what i want you to do is 
1. tell me which is the best method and database structure for me to save my models considerng my 
my model has the following structure a. it can hold any amount of vertices 
b. each verticee has a x y and z positon 
c. the x y and z are always less than one 
d. each model is saved with the name as string for example "pyramid" , "square"
e.there can only be one model with the same name of the string 





write me a pytho code that draws a bell curve using matplotlib 
and asks the user the the standard deviation range 
for example input 1 = 2  ,input 2 =  3 
and then plots the bell curve and the curve is shaded in light blue curve 
and shades the region between input1 and input2 in light red 


make a python that does the following 
it draws the bar graph that plots the efficiecy on the y axis and the number of cosecutive on the x-axis 
and also label the x and y axis with their respective names 
name of the graph should be efficiency against number of cosecutive days task is performed 
and the there is 30 percent drop in efficiency with each cosecutive increase in the consecutive days number 


also add this property that if in between there is a break in the y axis that is if the y axis goes to zero 
there is 50 percent regeneration in the efficiency 
and the efficiency goes to 100 percent after 2 day break 

current project left at initializing the sqlite library 

write me a matplot lib python code that does the following things

-> that plots x = 1/y and where x is from 0 to 100 
-> the graph line should be dark blue 
-> x label is Ability 
-> y label is Motivation 
-> the programme asks the user to choose ability from 1 to 100 
-> the programme asks the user to choose Motivation from 1 to 100 
-> the programme asks the user to choose taskNamae 
-> it draws a circle on the x and y location of the graph 
-> on the right side of circle is shows the taskName , can you help me wit this 


everything is good but i dont see the action line which plots y = 1/x 
and the action line label should be action line 

i am not able to get the func (x) right 
can you help me get a curve which is concave towards upward and right 


the lines in the [] should be kept exaclty the same 
[1. **what am i without my mistakes** 
2. **Kindness is all the emotion i have , and its all i need to be honest , and its the most powerful one** 
3. **god throws me in hell and i would find a way to praise it**  
4. **classify things under my control and not under my control** 
5. **change your Questions change your life** 
6. **i am an INVESTOR and investor only** 
7. **"Smile is the person's most beautiful jewellery.”**
8. **the real jail is not jail but the not being able to explore** 
9. **i carry the calmness of 9 seas** 
10. **i manage stack and that too by “2 and heap Rule “**]
make then in a format of graph TD of notion 
where A(Habit) --> B(1. **what am i without my mistakes** ) 
connects to all the habits till the number 10 

this is my pyramid.h " -- paste pyramid.h here " and 
this is my pyramid.cpp " -- paste pyramid.cpp here " and 
my model class mimics the pyrmaid class very closely in its functions 
but it has some special features 
it can hold any number of vertices  number of vertices
int model::getVertices() return the number of vertices in the std::vector<Vertex> vertices ; 
so you have to add this function but also 
this is my model.h class --paste model.h here -- 
the std::vector<Vertex> vertices from the model class has the same function called renderMyself 
it does things differently than pyramid.renderMyself() 
it assumes that the vertices vector of the model class contains the 
point of 3d placement of a 3d model and draws a line connecting each of them making it appear like a 3d model 
can you help me with the code of model.cpp so that i dont have to write it again 
also be very very careful while writing the model.renderMyself() because it should appear that you are writing a 3d model 


this is my terminal commands "sachinjain@MacBook-Air-de-sachin gamemachine % cd libs

how should i make changes to makefile to use the sqlite3 inside my projects 


draw me a picture of an investor  
looking in to the far far future 
but he not speculating 
he is using maths and probabilites 
so give the scene a mathematical background 


draw me a picture of a person imagning 50 variations 
and focusing on the variation which is the correct one 

what happened is that 
yesteraday i backed up my mac 
and after backing it up i deleted a bunch of day 
with that i think i also deleted SDL2 library 
now i installed it using brew 
and its installed but it is currently not in my default system path probably usr/local/bin 
so i cannot get it inside my c++ game 
i installed brew on m1 mac and its in opt/brew -- something like that 
and cant seem to pinpint where the problem is 
sdl2 -config --version is currently working 
makefile is perfect with -lsdl2 linker flag 
can you show me a better way the way it was before 
where i could use sdl2 direcltly by linker flags -lsdl2 and 



you described a method which used command line tools to 
download libraires using CURL command 
then you Tar to extract the archive 
then you changed to the active directory 
then you use configure and sudo make install 
to install the library directory to usr/local/bin


i have my macs previous version stored in time machine brave
 
and i want my mac to eaxctly revert to the previous version is there method 

what is the best way to render 3d surfaces which is comprised of vertices which contain 3d positon
