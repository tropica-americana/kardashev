we create a inputThread function 
and let it run till the game.isRunning is true (1) 

input thread functions connects with a nothingClass and runs the function processInput on that nothingClass object 


solve the terminal problem inside our programme 

create a artficial terminal inside our programme that can be used to 
script and change the state of the programme 


i have a nothing class that looks like this               nothingClass {} ;  
nothingClass is stored in "./nothingClass/nothingClass.cpp" with respect to main 
i have various shapes in my programme which are derived from nothing class eg pyramid , square 
each of these shapes object have proccessInput methods 
what i wanna do is create a 

void inputThread (vector <nothingClass *> hector , const SDL_MouseMotionEvent & mouseEvent) {} function 
which connect to vector of  shapes derived from objects derived from nothing class 

what i wanna do is
take terminal input between two return presses "return/enter" and "return/enter" and read the 
text from the terminal and stores it inside std::string terminalText ; 
make no mistake that the inputThread function runs in its own sepereate thread and is connected 
to shape and processes its input changes 
now the structure of inputThread is such that 
it has various switch cases for each type of terminalText 
when case "rotate 0" 
it goes to vector[0] and calls the rotate method such that 
rotate method take glm::vec3 orientationVector ; as a paramter 
which contains the x , y , z  angles of rotation in radians 
mouseEvent.xrel is taken as orientationVector.x  += (xrel is thought to be in degrees and converted to radians ) ;
mouseEvent.yrel is taken as orientationVector.y += yrel( proceeses as the xrel was processed into radians  ) ; 
convert both orientationVector.x and orientationVector.y into radians which were initially in degrees 


i want the getTerminalTextThread to be a sepereate thread and it should take a refrence to a 
string terminalText as shown in the code above 
getTerminalText is while loop that changes the value of terminalText based on the userInput 
is runs in its seperate thread so its no problem to wait for the userinput 
chat gpt please check whether getTerminalTextThread does exactly that and when the user has 
entered the text and pressed enter it should make the value of terminalText as the userInput 
and the userInput stored in the terminalText should be proccessed by the inputThread accordingly 
game.proccessInput is the  part where the game.mouseEvent gets updated every time 
if there are any problems with the code then show me the problematic code and then the correct
code but do not provide any explainations 


the problem is the getTerminalText is showing abnormal behavior  and preventing the rest 
of the code from working properly . 
it might be the race phenomenon could you correct the above code using mutex so that abnormal 
behavior disappears 

what is the difference between 
std::cin >> stringVar ; 
and
std::getline (std::cin , stringVar ) ; 


i have written this code as shown in the parenthesis "" 
this is all of my pyramid.cpp code and the problem is that the first vertex of the pyramid is 
not translating properly i dont know whats the problem 
can you tell me 



this is my excel sheet in between the parenthesis""
my delegate section is pretty ugly can you correct it for me to make it look more presentable 
and my do and delte section is also empty please insert two or three tasks which are 
very human like in the delay and delete section also and 
present me the final version which i can copy paste in my google sheets 

make me a google sheet that  i can copy paste into my google sheets 
in A column should be time zone ()
and B column should be tasks to be done in the time zone 
time zone characterstics should include 
total time zones = 12 
duration of time zone should be 2 hours
use the tasks from the above spread sheet 
8 - 12 should include the tasks of highest priority 
9 PM to 1 PM should also include the tasks of highest priority  
use AM and PM in the time zones 
from 1PM to 8PM i sleep 
allocate major time to skill development from the tasks above
